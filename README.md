# Scambaiting Tools
Tools that you can use while doing your dirty work!

This is a continous project, so not everything is finished, and more files will be added, if I am continuing this.

# FakeCMD
As the name suggests, this is a fake command prompt that you can use to trick scammers into using the program.
Commands:
  tree - Doesn't actually display a tree, but instead, claims to scan the tree files, and then display 0 Errors, 0 Warnings and 0 Infections.
  cd - Searchs for "CD's" & "DVDs" & "CD-ROMs", but then displays that there are none.
  netstat - Displays two fake connections, one is a indian IP Address (fake), and another one which is the computer, and then displays No Infections found
  dir - Displays main directories with one extra, CornHub ;), and then claims that the CornHub directory is infected.
  
And everything else displays the average. "command is not recognised" message


If you do have any ideas, tweet them at me.

NOTE: You will have to compile the program yourself -If Needed- and change the CMD in System32. Do remember to use it on a virtual machine though :/
